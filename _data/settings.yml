  about_markdown: |
    The Good Home Team catapulted onto the North Texas Real Estate Scene when two brothers, Nick Good & Austin Good, decided to fuse their unique skill sets together to formulate a revolutionary real estate company that towers above the rest.

    The Good Home Team is built on a strong foundation of core values and purpose. We operate in a fun, exciting and challenging environment that helps all of us to achieve our goals. Each of our staff members and agents is dedicated to teamwork, self-improvement, positive attitudes and most importantly, a passion and drive to surpass the expectations of every client who does business with us.

    Many agents strive for customer satisfaction, but on our team, satisfaction is not enough. We work constantly to improve our systems and processes, and as a result we go well beyond the standard level of service provided by most Realtors. We are obsessed with serving our clients in a way that leaves them feeling thrilled by our team, not merely satisfied by it.
