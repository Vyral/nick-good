I recently sat down on Facebook Live for a great interview about home buying—specifically, new construction home buying. I answered some commonly asked questions about the process, gave tips, and more. **Here’s an outline of the discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the topic(s) that interest you the most:**

0:40- How buying a new home is different from buying a pre-owned home.

1:15- Is hiring a real estate agent necessary for a buyer?

2:20- The different new home options for buyers and how to negotiate with the listing agent.

3:30- Will new home construction be affected by the recent market slowdown?

5:15- Working with a builder versus working with a homeowner.

6:30- Some more benefits of buying a new home with an experienced agent.
