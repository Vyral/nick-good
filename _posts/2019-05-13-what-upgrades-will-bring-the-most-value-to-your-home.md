I recently sat down to answer a few common questions I’ve been hearing as we head into the busy season of the year.

**We’re really seeing buyer demand pick up in the last few weeks, especially in the first-time buyer market.** We’re also getting a lot of feedback from our buyers that they really prefer a move-in ready home and they’re willing to wait even if they can’t find one right away.

Because of that, we wanted to go through a few ideas for updating your home if you’re thinking of selling it soon.

The first thing that works well is bringing more light in. You can do this through lightening up the paint colors of your walls and ceilings, cleaning your windows, and throwing open the drapes.

**Buyers also want to see updated kitchens.** New counters, backsplash, and stainless steel appliances are also worthy of your consideration. Just one new stainless steel appliance in the kitchen can do the trick.

As far as the bathroom is concerned, you should probably make some updates there too. Changing out the vanity is a good idea, as is modernizing the light fixtures and mirrors. A simple wood-framed mirror can work wonders. A frameless glass shower is also considered an upgrade over the standard bath and shower. **Buyers really want the upgraded bathroom look.**

Having one style of flooring throughout the home is also huge. Buyers don’t like having different floorings in each room. They want more of a uniform look. Either hardwood floor throughout, or hardwood and carpet just in the bedrooms.

**Finally, spend some time on your curb appeal.** Trim those bushes, replace any faulty door knockers or handles, and repaint and recaulk around the windows in your home. Having great curb appeal gives buyers greater confidence that the home is taken care of.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about preparing your home for sale or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
