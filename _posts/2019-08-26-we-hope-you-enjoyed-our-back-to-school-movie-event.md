Our Back-to-School Movie Event was an absolute blast, and it wouldn’t have been the same without you. We appreciate you coming out and helping make this event such a great time, and we hope you enjoyed yourself as much as we did. Without your continued support, the Good Home Team wouldn’t be where it is today. So for that, we thank you. We’d also like to thank our great sponsors, who made this event possible. We truly appreciate Lawyers Title, Capital Title, Align Foundation, and Crest Exteriors, as well as Michael DeBacker with The CORE Team at USA Mortgage. We look forward to more fun times with all of you in the future. If you missed this event, don’t worry: There will be plenty of other great opportunities in the future. As always, if you have any questions about real estate, upcoming events, or anything else going on in our community, please reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
