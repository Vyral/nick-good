The holiday season is quickly approaching, and many would-be home sellers in our area have been asking whether there’s still time to sell in 2019. A lot of these people believe that their chance has passed and that selling during the holidays is not a good move.&nbsp;

Actually, though, selling during the later months of the year can bring incredible results. Did you know that December tends to be the third-best time of year for home sellers in our area to put their properties on the market? It’s true, and today I’ll be sharing six key reasons that selling over the holidays is such a good idea:

**1\. Buyers who look at homes during the holidays are very serious.** Very few “tire-kickers” turn up during the holiday season.&nbsp;

**2\. There are fewer competing homes on the market during the holidays.** Many sellers fall for the common myth that you shouldn’t list at this time of year, so those who do choose to list can benefit from this decreased competition.&nbsp;

**3\. Supply is low, which means demand is high.** Buyers are much more willing to pay top dollar when there are fewer available homes on the market.&nbsp;

**4\. You can strategically restrict showings around your schedule.** The holidays are a busy time of year, but sellers should be aware that they have the option to schedule showings around whatever parties, gatherings, or activities they have going on.&nbsp;

**5\. Buyers have more time to look at home.** Many buyers get off work for the holidays, which gives them a larger window of time to look at your home.&nbsp;

**6\. Holiday decor helps homes show better.** There’s nothing like the holidays to make people feel sentimental, so tasteful touches of holiday decor can really make a difference in how buyers see your home.&nbsp;
