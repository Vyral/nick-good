Can you believe that 2019 is almost over? Now that another great year is wrapping up, I have a special request of you—one that could win you a $100 gift card.&nbsp;

First, as always, if you’re new to our channel, please hit that “subscribe channel” button for real estate news from the Dallas-Fort Worth market; we typically release one to two every week.&nbsp;

I’m excited to announce that we’re finishing up our 2019 Homeownership Survey. I’ve personally just tested it out and it takes less than a minute to do. It’s only six questions long. Once we get these results, we’ll share this Dallas-Fort Worth data with established real estate publications. [Click here to take the survey\!&nbsp;](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2K2YSYN)

The survey questions include things like, **“Do you think home prices are going to go up in the next 12 months?” and “Are you thinking about selling your home or refinancing in the next 12 months?”**

Since we appreciate your commitment to participating, we’ll enter you into a drawing for that $100 gift card.&nbsp;

Feel free to contact us and let us know if you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in 2020. It’s an election year, so we’ll have plenty of reasons to discuss where the real estate market and the rest of the economy are headed.&nbsp;

If you have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you any way I can.
