About six months ago, a buddy of mine told my wife and I about Wyze, a company founded by people who used to work at Amazon. He said that they have great quality cameras for a fraction of the price of other brands: just $19.99. Since I’m a frugal sort of homeowner, I was naturally very interested to hear about Wyze security cameras.

To set them up, you only need three items: the camera itself, a mobile phone, and an internet connection. The camera we bought shoots video in 1080 full HD and has two-way audio, meaning you can both hear and talk through the camera as well. Along with the clear night vision feature, this makes the Wyze camera good for both indoor and outdoor use. Additionally, the camera has 14 days’ worth of free cloud recordings, so you can buy an SD card to record and save footage if you need to.&nbsp;

Wyze security cameras are compatible with both Amazon’s Alexa feature and Google Assistant, which makes automating your home much easier.

Wyze also has other affordable products like automated light bulbs that can be turned on and off according to a schedule you set for them or brightened/dimmed through your smartphone. The Wyze smart plugs can turn any plug-in device into a smart device that can be turned on and off with your phone as well.

Wyze front door locks are only $89, though we haven’t tested them yet. They’re not battery-operated; if you’re using them for exterior camera use, you’ll need a long USB cable to plug in somewhere inside the house. For just another $15, you can buy a weather-proof case to set it up outside without fear of the elements.

What sort of home security products do you use? I would love to hear about them. In the meantime, if you have any questions about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you, no matter your real estate goals.
