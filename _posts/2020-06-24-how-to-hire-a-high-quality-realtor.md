What’s the best way to find (and hire) a high-quality Realtor? Actually, it’s simple. All you need to do is follow these five tips:**1\. Check out their online reviews**. Any agent can tell you they’re great, but reviews don’t lie. Reviews allow you to see feedback from people who have worked with a given Realtor or team in the past. This can offer valuable insight into what your experience would be like if you chose to hire them.&nbsp;

**2\. “Stalk” them online.** Visiting an agent’s social media pages will help you see how this person conducts themselves, in general.**3\. Find out if they’re tech-savvy.** Unfortunately, not too many agents barely know how to work their cell phones, let alone leverage the latest real estate technology. So check out their website, read their reviews, and study any other materials they’ve made available for signs of their technological competency.&nbsp;

**4\. Ask for proof of their track record.** If an agent tells you they’ve sold a certain number of homes in the past 12 months, for instance, ask them to prove it. According to the National Association of Realtors, the average real estate agent sells 11 houses or fewer in a given year. Here on the Good Team, we sell well over 200, and we’d be happy to prove it to you.**&nbsp;**

**5\. Ask how they plan to market your home.** The right agent is one who will be proactive, rather than simply placing a sign in your yard and praying that your property sells. They must have systems and strategies in place to expose as many buyers as possible to your home.
