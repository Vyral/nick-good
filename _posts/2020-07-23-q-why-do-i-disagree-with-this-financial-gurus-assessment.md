Today we’re taking a closer look at recent comments from financial guru Suze Orman about the 2020 housing market. &nbsp;She posted on Facebook recently about why people should wait until the fall months to buy a home and wait for a wave of disclosures instead of taking advantage of the current conditions and interest rates. Let’s just say I don’t quite agree with her assessment.&nbsp;

Here’s an outline of the discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you the most:

0:30- Evidence of The Good Home Team’s success from one of our recent clients<br>2:25- What Suze Orman actually said about the 2020 market via social media<br>3:40- What Suze got wrong about her assessment of the foreclosure market<br>4:16- The national impact on real estate from COVID-19<br>6:00- What will the pandemic recession lead to in terms of real estate prices?<br>6:40- The latest on the Dallas/Fort Worth real estate market and the main problem COVID-19 has caused<br>7:52- What does this mean to you as a homebuyer or seller?<br>8:55- Why sitting on the sidelines won’t do you any good these days<br>9:40- Wrapping things up

If you have any questions for me about anything I discussed today or anything related to real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
