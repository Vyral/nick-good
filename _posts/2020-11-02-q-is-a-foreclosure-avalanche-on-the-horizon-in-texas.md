Some analysts predict there will be roughly 200,000 foreclosures in Texas over the next 12 months. Will that really happen? My team and I have our finger on the pulse of the real estate market, and compared to what we’re hearing from buyers and sellers in the DFW Metroplex, we’re forecasting a different story. Most news items regarding foreclosures adopt a “sky is falling” tone, but today I’ll explain why we won’t see a repeat of 2008 and which options homeowners facing financial hardship have.&nbsp;
