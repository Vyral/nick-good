Here’s how buyers can win in this market.

If you’re buying a home in this ultra-competitive marketplace, you’re not likely going to have a lot of fun, but there are ways of setting yourself up for success.

For one, hiring the right real estate agent in this marketplace is more imperative than ever. Interest rates and inventory levels have reached historic lows. We’re currently at 1.4 months of inventory for all of Dallas and Fort Worth, meaning it would take roughly six weeks for us to sell off all our available homes, assuming no others came on the market.

According to a CBS report that recently came out where homebuyers were interviewed about their experiences in the market, homes are being shown 91 times and receive 39 offers or more. Having an experienced real estate agent on your side is critical if you want to set your offer up for success. So how does the Good Home Team help homebuyers?

First, we’re well-connected within the Realtor community and we keep our finger on the pulse of the market so we can tell you what to expect.&nbsp;

Next, **make sure your representative is doing everything they can to find homes that aren’t yet officially for sale**, also known as off-market properties. That means they should be cold-calling and door-knocking in the area you’re interested in making a purchase and otherwise utilizing marketing programs designed to identify homeowners who are thinking of selling in the near future. Then, your Realtor can play matchmaker with you and those prospective sellers. The advantage of off-market properties is that you won’t have to compete with other buyers to buy them.

When it comes time for you to buy a house, be sure to reach out to us. Let us help you feel secure and confident in your transaction and ultimately put you on the path to success.
