This new program lets you accurately track your home’s worth.

Most homeowners want a way to keep track of their home’s value, but unfortunately, there are few ways to easily and accurately do so—until now, that is. **I’m excited to announce we’ve recently partnered with a proprietary technology system that can determine your home’s value.&nbsp;**

The median price of homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area has increased by 12.2% year over year. You may have built a strong level of equity within the last year, and our new system can help you see exactly how much your home’s value has grown. In today’s market, it’s something you definitely want to keep track of—and we make it simple.

The service also details how much you’ve paid toward your interest and principal balance. Further, it can show you different ways you could refinance your home and how it would change your monthly payments, interest rates, savings, and more.&nbsp;

If that’s not enough already, there’s even more it can do. It shows you how much you would save over time and how much quicker you’d pay off your mortgage if you paid extra on your monthly bill. This feature is one I love to play around with, and it shows you just how far your dollar can really go when it comes to long-term savings. For example, if I paid $150 extra each month, it would save me $31,137 and help me pay off my home five years early.

**If you’ve ever thought about buying a new home and renting out your current one, the program even shows how much you could make on Airbnb.** Regardless of what you’re looking to do, it’s an excellent service to take advantage of. Better yet, it comes at zero cost. All you need to do is enter your address, email, and phone number on this website. After then, you’ll get a customized report each month that details your home’s value.

It’s a great program that helps homeowners track everything they need to know about their property’s value. If you have any questions or would like to learn more, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
