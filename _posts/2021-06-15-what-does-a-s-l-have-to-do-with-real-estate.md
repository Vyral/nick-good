I noticed that I’ve been sending you videos asking for your business, but I haven’t even properly introduced myself to you\! Today I’d like to change that by dating myself a little bit. Remember the days of AOL Instant Messenger? Back then, A.S.L meant “age, sex, location,” so here’s my A.S.L:

My name is Nick Good, the team leader and owner of the Good Home Team with eXp Realty, and I’ve been in the business since 2005. I was born in Dallas but grew up in Plano, and I currently reside in McKinney, Texas, with my wife, two children, and a Goldendoodle.

Before I got into the real estate industry, I was delivering pizzas in college. At the time, my brother and I wanted to get involved in the real estate investment game, so when I saw a job posting for a real estate assistant, I applied and got the job. That job opened my eyes to the huge opportunity to become a Realtor, **the kind of person who could help clients buy, sell, and invest in real estate.**

Typically when people buy or sell real estate, they’re going through some kind of life event. That could be just being tired of throwing money away on rents; studies show that homeowners have 44 times the net worth that renters do. It could also be that people are getting married and want to start a family, meaning they’d need to upsize their house. The opposite could also be true, in the case of those whose children have moved out and they no longer need all the space in their home. That’s what we love about the real estate business—being able to help people through whatever situation they’re in at the time.

**I just wanted to make sure that you all got to know me better before I ask for your business.** If you or someone you know is thinking about buying or selling a home, please let us at the Good Home Team know. If you’re interested in learning about how to invest in real estate, we’d love to help you get started.

P.S.: We are currently hiring for real estate agents, so keep an eye on our blog for a video where we’ll explain our hiring process\!
