Right now, we’re seeing an increase in inventory in our market, so it’s a perfect time to buy. If you’re a first-time buyer or you’re worried about your current home selling too quickly, now is the best time to buy that we’ve seen in a while.&nbsp;

Cash offers are 4x more likely to get accepted than financed offers, and they’re typically 2% to 5% lower than financed offers. The good news is that, as a homebuyer, you can upgrade your offer to cash. **We recently partnered with a company called Homeward that allows us to offer you a program to make this upgrade.&nbsp;**

All you have to do is get pre-approved through Homeward so you can start shopping now and be ready to buy as soon as the home you want comes on the market. Once that home does come on the market, they’ll help you write a cash offer for it. If you’re facing a multiple-offer situation, your cash offer will stand out to the seller. After the seller accepts your offer, all you need to do is finalize the purchase. When that’s done, you’re free to move in. It’s so simple\! **If you have a home you need to sell, we offer another program through Homeward that will help you buy before selling.&nbsp;**

If you’re interested in learning more about these programs, give me a call. I’d love to explain how they work. There are certain stipulations to be aware of, but they’re super simple and represent a great opportunity to take advantage of this market.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
