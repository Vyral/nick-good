You’ve probably heard in the news that the housing market is crazy with how many offers sellers are getting and how high sales prices are going. While it’s understandable that might make things look scary, here are two reasons why now is the perfect storm and you should buy:

**1\. Inventory levels.** We’re seeing inventory levels increase again. Right now, we’re at 1.5 months of inventory. More inventory means more options for buying.

**2\. False foreclosure.** Buyers are waiting because they’re anticipating a massive rush of foreclosures. The reality is that there are very few homeowners in trouble. There are only 3.5% of homeowners in the loan forbearance program, and they all have a lot of equity to sell. The yearly number of foreclosures has stayed the same the past few years.

If you are waiting for prices to come down, I’m sorry, but it’s not happening. Let’s get you into a home and take advantage of the low rates and start building equity. Give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions about buying or real estate in general. I would love to help you.
