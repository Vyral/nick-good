On average, homeowners have 44 times the net worth of a renter. Our mission here at the Good Home Team is to help our clients become homeowners so that they can start building equity and raising their net worth.

That’s why I’m excited to announce our new homeownership program called The Right to Purchase Program. **Under this program, you can choose from homes that are listed for sale and rent one for up to three years with no obligation to purchase.** You’ll know from the start what the monthly rent and purchase price will be. If you end up not liking that house or your life circumstances have changed such that it wouldn’t make sense to buy it, you’re not tied down to any long-term decisions.

To qualify to live in a single-family home or townhouse under this program, you just need to meet the following requirements:

* An annual income of $40,000 or more
* You can’t have filed chapter seven bankruptcy
* Neither you nor any member of your household can have been evicted within the last five years
* Neither you nor anyone in your household can be a felon or registered sex offender
* You must submit two times the monthly rent as a security deposit

Another great thing about The Right to Purchase Program is that it’s very pet-friendly. We looked at some other programs out there that weren’t pet-friendly, but we scrapped those because we know how important pets are to people’s families.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in learning more about this exclusive program that will put you on the path to homeownership, reach out and give me a call or send an email. I’d love to help you.
