Do your pets have the final say on where you get to live? A lot of people have taken furry family members into their homes during the pandemic, so let’s see how your pets may be affecting your ability to move.

It seems like demand for everything increased during the pandemic, and pets were no exception. At one point, shelters in the Dallas/Fort Worth area were running out of pets. If you are a recent pet owner, would you be willing to move to accommodate your new friend?

A recent survey by the National Association of Realtors found that **43% of people would be willing to move to accommodate their pets.** Usually, this becomes an issue when someone is renting. Pet fees can get expensive, and they can be the final straw to get someone to finally buy a home. We also see that younger people are more willing to move for their pets.

**Homes.com recently found that 20% of buyers have rejected a home because of pet-related reasons.** If you’re a seller, what can you do to make sure this doesn’t happen to you? First, they want more space. From there, they want a secure, fenced-in yard and proximity to trails or parks.

There’s no point in denying it: Pets are part of the family. If you need help finding a home that fits your pet’s needs, reach out to us via phone or email. We are always willing to help.
