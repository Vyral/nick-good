It’s time to talk about those dreaded property taxes. Home values have increased a ton over the last few years, and your property taxes have probably increased as a result. Fortunately, you don’t have to take your tax increases lying down. Today I want to share the steps you need to take to protest your property tax increases:

**1\. What is your home’s value?** If houses around you are selling for a certain amount, and your property’s value came in at the same amount, you might not have a strong case to get your taxes lowered. To find out your home’s value, you can speak with a trusted Realtor or pay an appraiser. My team can provide a comparative market analysis for you free of charge. Just reach out to us if you’d like to learn more.&nbsp;

**2\. File a written notice by May 15.** Send the notice to your county’s appraisal review board. If you don’t know where it is, you can usually find the information on your county’s website.&nbsp;

**3\. Gather evidence.** Get your market value report and take photos of issues with your home. Hidden defects can include things such as foundation issues, plumbing problems, an old heating system, etc.&nbsp;

**4\. Plan on how to plead your case.** When you go in front of the review board, you need to show your evidence and argue your case. In some cases, you can get your appraised value lowered by just speaking on the phone with a review board member.&nbsp;

**5\. Get ready to appear before the board.** They must be notified at least 15 days before your hearing. Then, 14 days before your meeting, your appraisal district must send you a copy of your property taxpayer remedies, give you your hearing procedures, and notify you of your right to review documentation.&nbsp;

**6\. Appear before the board.** Get your evidence ready and plead your case. Remember that the board only wants to hear about your evidence. Don’t talk about what tax bracket you’re in, what issues you have with how the county is spending your money, or anything like that. You don’t have a ton of time, so get to the point.&nbsp;
