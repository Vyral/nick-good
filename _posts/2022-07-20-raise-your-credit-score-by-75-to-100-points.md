Do you want to raise your credit scores by 75 to 100 points in six months or less? Today I’m joined by Jesse from MSI Credit Repair. He'll tell us how to help our clients raise their credit scores by 75 to 100 points to either get a mortgage approval or receive a better interest rate.

MSI will guide you as you go through the six-month process. They’ll break down your credit report, give you a plan, and start removing the negative items from your credit history. In six months MSI can remove 50% to 80% of the negative items in your credit history to increase your score by 75 to 100 points. Your job is just to pay your bills on time; they’ll handle the rest.
